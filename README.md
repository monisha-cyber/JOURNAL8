Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?
What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?
What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
Module 8 Journal
Artemis Financial is a consulting company that specializes in developing individualized financial plans for its clients. These plans cover areas such as savings, retirement, investments, and insurance. As part of their mission, they emphasize that “Security is everyone’s responsibility.” They have a public web interface and are seeking expertise from Global Rain, a software engineering company, on how to protect their client data and financial information. Specifically, Artemis Financial wants to add a file verification step to its web application to ensure secure communications. This involves implementing a data verification step in the form of a checksum when transferring data through their web application.
During the vulnerability assessment, I effectively identified and addressed security vulnerabilities in Artemis Financials software. Secure coding practices are crucial because they prevent unauthorized access, data breaches, and potential financial losses. Software security adds value to a company’s overall well-being by safeguarding sensitive information, maintaining customer trust, and ensuring compliance with legal and regulatory requirements.
The vulnerability assessment presented challenges in identifying hidden vulnerabilities and understanding potential attack vectors. To increase security layers, I implemented secure communication mechanisms and followed best practices. In the future, I will use automated vulnerability assessment tools and threat modeling techniques to assess vulnerabilities and choose appropriate mitigation strategies.
To ensure functionality and security, I thoroughly evaluated the code and application. After refactoring, I conducted rigorous testing to identify any newly introduced vulnerabilities. In this assignment, I utilized tools like static code analysis, penetration testing, and secure coding guidelines.
For future employers, I would display my successful completion of this assignment as evidence of my skills in secure coding, vulnerability assessment, and risk mitigation. It demonstrates my ability to enhance software security while maintaining functionality.
